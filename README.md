#### install it via pip/pip3
```
pip install gguf-node
```
#### enter the user menu by (if no py command; use python/python3 instead)
```
py -m gguf_node
```
>Please select:
>1. download the full pack
>2. clone the node only
>
>Enter your choice (1 to 2): _
#### for new/all user(s)
opt `1` to download the compressed comfy pack (7z), decompress it, and run the .bat file striaght (idiot option)

#### for existing user/developer(s)
opt `2` to clone the gguf repo to the current directory (either navigate to `./ComfyUI/custom_nodes` first or drag and drop there after the clone)

alternatively, you could execute the git clone command to perform that task (see below):
- navigate to `./ComfyUI/custom_nodes`
- clone the gguf repo to that folder by
```
git clone https://github.com/calcuis/gguf
```
*same operation for the standalone pack; then you should be able to see it under `Add Node >`*

check the dropdown menu for `gguf`

🐷🐷📄 for the latest update, gguf-connector deployment copy is now attached to the node itself; don't need to clone it to site-packages; and, as the default setting in comfyui is sufficient; no dependencies needed right away 🙌 no extra step anymore

#### other(s): get it somewhere else trustworthy/reliable
you are also welcome to get the node through other available channels, i.e., comfy-cli, comfyui-manager (search `gguf` from the bar; and opt to install it there should be fine; see picture below), etc.

`gguf` node is no conflict with the popular `comfyui-gguf` node (can coexist; and this project actually inspired by it; built upon its code base; we are here honor their developers' contribution; we all appreciate their great work truly; then you could test our version and their version both; or mixing up use, switch in between freely, all for your own purpose and need); and is more lightweight (no dependencies needed), more functions (i.e., built-in `tensor cutter`, `gguf convertor`), compatible with the latest version numpy and other updated libraries come with comfyui

for the demo workflow (picture) above, you could get the test model gguf [here](https://huggingface.co/calcuis/illustrious), test it whether you can generate the similar outcome or not

#### setup (in general)
- drag gguf file(s) to diffusion_models folder (./ComfyUI/models/diffusion_models)
- drag clip or encoder(s) to text_encoders folder (./ComfyUI/models/text_encoders)
- drag controlnet adapter(s), if any, to controlnet folder (./ComfyUI/models/controlnet)
- drag lora adapter(s), if any, to loras folder (./ComfyUI/models/loras)
- drag vae decoder(s) to vae folder (./ComfyUI/models/vae)

#### workflow
- drag the workflow json file to the activated browser; or
- drag any generated output file (i.e., picture, video, etc.; which contains the workflow metadata) to the activated browser

#### simulator
- design your own prompt; or
- generate a random prompt/descriptor by the [simulator](https://prompt.calcuis.us) (though it might not be applicable for all)

#### cutter (new feature: cut safetensors in half - bf16 to fp8)
- drag safetensors file(s) to diffusion_models folder (./ComfyUI/models/diffusion_models)
- choose the second last option from the gguf menu: `TENSOR Cutter (Beta)`
- select your safetensors model inside the box; don't need to connect anything; it works independently
- click `Queue` (run); then you can simply check the processing progress from console
- when it was done; the quantized/half-cut safetensors file will be saved to the output folder (./ComfyUI/output)

#### convertor (new feature: convert safetensors to gguf)
- drag safetensors file(s) to diffusion_models folder (./ComfyUI/models/diffusion_models)
- choose the last option from the gguf menu: `GGUF Convertor (Alpha)`
- select your safetensors model inside the box; don't need to connect anything; it works independently also
- click `Queue` (run); then you can simply check the processing progress from console
- when it was done; the converted gguf file will be saved to the output folder (./ComfyUI/output)

**little tips**: to make a so-called `fast` model; could try to cut the selected model (bf16) half (use cutter) first; and convert the trimmed model (fp8) to gguf (pretty much the same file size with the bf16 quantized output but less tensors inside; load faster theoretically, but no guarantee, you should test it probably, and might also be prepared for the significant quality loss)
